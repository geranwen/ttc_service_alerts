The goal of this project is to create an interactive visual website or web app, which will allow users to interact and see which part of the Toronto Subway and other TTC services are interrupted. 

The dataset will be scrapped from ttc.ca/service-alerts, processed and stored. The goal is to have ongoing monitoring and scrapping of the website, which means the dataset will grow and be kept up-to-date. 

The final presentation can be an interactive visual website, although the idea of an 'interactive visual journalistic piece' is also rather attractive.
